# Rank-Calculator
I created this application in order enable a student to determine quickly and easily, his/her rank in their respective classes. Before this application, students had to manually scan the CGPA of all students in the result-list in order to determine where they stand as compared to their peers. Since this proved out to be a very tedious and cumbersome process, I decided to write a script which essentially scans all the CGPAs into a python list and prompts you to enter your own CGPA in order to quickly determine your rank/position in the class, thereby making the process very friendly and saving time and energy.
