# Rank-Calculator
I created this application in order to determine quickly and easily, a student's rank in his/her class. Before this application, students had to manually scan the CGPA of each student in the list in order to determine where they stand in their respective classes. 
Since this proved out to be a very tedious and cumbersome process, I decided to write a script which essentially scans all the CGPAs into a python list and prompts you to enter your own CGPA in order to quickly determine your rank in the class,
thus saving time and energy for everyone.
